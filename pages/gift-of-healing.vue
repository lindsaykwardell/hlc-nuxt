          Give the gift of healing this holiday season! If your friend or loved
          one is looking for a supportive community of health professionals, you
          can help them by donating to the Healthy Living Community. The gift of
          healing is a gift of love and compassion. It is a gift of life, and it
          is a gift of hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can give the gift of healing in three ways:
          <ul>
            <li>By paying for membership in Healthy Living Community for one year.</li>
            <li>By paying for membership in Healthy Living Community for one year PLUS a body work session.</li>
            <li>By paying for a single visit with one of our health practitioners.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever you choose, you can make a difference in the health and wellness of your loved ones.

          medicine and various other modalities. Our goal is to do this in a
          compassionate, cost-effective, and earth-friendly manner.
