In order to keep our clinic running on the sliding scale payment model, we have established a Patient Care Fund. Individuals can donate to this fund to directly support health service costs for those who may be unable to afford payments at this time.

Want the unique care you receive at this clinic to be accessible to more people? Consider donating to this fund!
