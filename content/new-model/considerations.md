* Individuals who choose to pay for a service (procedure or vaccination) in full will have the opportunity to request a superbill. This superbill will allow for the possibility of insurance reimbursement for all services you receive at this clinic. Please see this page for our standard full cost for services. Remember, your insurance will still cover labs, imaging, and prescriptions. 
* We are happy to offer alternative, non-monetary options to pay for an appointment, such as barter. Dr. Kerry will come to an individualized agreement on barter terms with one who chooses this option. Communicate with Dr. Kerry if this sounds like the best option for you given your financial situation.
