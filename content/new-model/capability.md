Though it may feel uncomfortable to determine a payment amount that feels right for you or your family, this model has been devised to make the unique functional healthcare Healthy Living Community offers accessible to all. We fundamentally value every single one of our members, and what you offer to our community.

If you are struggling with determining what you can pay, this guide may help:

**Factors to consider when determining payment capability.**

Consider paying the maximum monthly, or full appointment cost, payment amount if you:

* own the home you live in.
* have a stable job.
* work part-time or choose to stay at home with your children by choice, not necessity.
* have investments, retirement savings, or inheritance.
* have resources available (family, savings) that you could access in a time of need.
* have insurance that covers a majority of your health care services.
* have an educational background that allows you to attain higher earnings, even if you are not currently employed.

Consider paying a reduced monthly or appointment payment if you:

* have significant debt.
* have medical expenses that are not covered by your insurance.
* are uninsured.
* financially support parent(s) or dependent(s).
* are a student.
* are unemployed, or have been recently laid off.
* receive state or federal assistance.

Above all, please do not stress about payments. Pay what feels right for you or your family! We understand that circumstances change--this model gives you flexibility to alter your payment amounts given your situation.
