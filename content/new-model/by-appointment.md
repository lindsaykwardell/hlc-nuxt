When you or a family member comes in for an appointment, you will be asked to pay what you can for the visit at that time. With a pay what you can model YOU get to decide what you pay for an appointment, not insurance. We are committed to being transparent regarding our actual cost for services (see our [Services Price List](/hlc-services-price-list.pdf)). You have the option to pay for an appointment in full OR decide on a payment amount that feels doable given your financial situation. Our Services Cost listings are meant to inform, not dictate, what you can pay.
