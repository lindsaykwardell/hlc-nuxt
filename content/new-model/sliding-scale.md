title: Sliding Scale Monthly Membership Payments
order: "1"

---
We have adopted a sliding scale monthly membership fee for Healthy Living Community. Each individual, or family, is responsible for determining their own monthly payment capabilities given their current financial situation. This model is designed to allow more people access to necessary health care services and to maintain the unique holistic functional care at Healthy Living Community.
