A message from Dr. Kerry:

"In an ideal world, health insurance would increase the accessibility of health care. It would truly be an investment in people’s health. Unfortunately, I often hear from patients that this isn’t true. Increasingly, people are paying more per month, with higher deductibles and fewer benefits. This discourages people from getting the care they need.

Additionally, several insurance companies have determined that because I am not considered a “Medical Home”, I am not eligible to be in the network for many of their plans. This means that patients either pay full price to stay with their preferred provider, or are forced to see new providers who don’t know their history and with whom they don’t have a relationship.

It is important to me to find a way to support my patients outside of the control of the insurance companies. I aim to create a model of primary care that will allow me to serve my patients in a way that is affordable and sustainable. My goal is that this new model will allow patients to feel that they are able to make a true and more meaningful investment in their health."

Healthy Living Community has adopted a “pay what you can” model of care with sliding scale payments for membership and appointments as a solution to the constraints of insurance. We understand that insurance is still necessary for many of our members. That’s why your insurance can still be used to cover prescriptions, labs, and imaging. You can also request a superbill to be submitted to your insurance for reimbursement. Depending on your insurance, you may get a portion, or all, of the appointment cost covered.

Even though we are moving away from insurance, there is one insurance that we do take-- OHP (Oregon Health Plan). We listened to the feedback of our community members and realized that not accepting OHP (Oregon’s Medicaid program) was a barrier to many community members who are unable to afford healthcare costs. In taking OHP we hope to ensure that functional, holistic, healthcare services are more accessible.
