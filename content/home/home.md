# Welcome to Healthy Living Community

## Your Non-Profit Community Health Center in SE Portland

<div class="py-5"><hr /></div>

### Together we can grow optimal health

At Healthy Living Community (HLC), we offer a different kind of healthcare. We serve people that:

* Want a personal and ongoing relationship with their healthcare provider in order to achieve their health and wellness goals.
* Are committed to taking action to improve their health and well-being, wherever they are on their health journey.
* Like us, believe that the healthcare and insurance industries are broken, and want to explore new models of care.

We are a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit that offers affordable, patient-centered, inclusive, and trauma-informed care in a beautiful and welcoming setting. We offer a sliding scale membership and office visit model, allowing our community members to pay what they can for the care they want and deserve. We focus on root causes of symptoms, and work with our patients on treatment plans that are both realistic and effective. Our patient care integrates medications with diet and exercise, as well as referrals to massage, acupuncture, naturopathic medicine and various other modalities. Our goal is to do this in a compassionate, cost-effective, and earth-friendly manner.

### At HLC We Believe

**_Healthcare is a human right_**

Every person should be able to access the holistic care they need and deserve. Our sliding scale model works to provide quality care at an affordable price, increasing care accessibility while moving away from the healthcare delivery system that often limits the care people are able to receive.

**_Health is holistic_**

Mind, body, and spirit-- health encompasses all aspects of our being and at HLC we ensure that the care we deliver affirms that.

**_Healthcare needs to be inclusive and trauma-informed_**

Healthy Living Community welcomes people of all identities and lived experiences. We know and celebrate that everybody and every body is different. We acknowledge that medical trauma is real, and our goal is to support you in finding a safe home for your medical care that allows you to embrace healing when and how you are ready for it. 

**_Healthcare should be a conversation, and there is no "one size fits all" model for health_**

We have a safe, affirming, clinic space and encourage open dialogue about health with your provider.

Our healthcare providers will always meet you where you are, educate, and discuss various treatment options (be it medication, supplements, acupuncture, naturopathic care, other modalities) to find an approach that best supports YOU.

**_Healthy communities grow healthy individuals_**

That’s why at HLC, we not only support the individual needs of our patients, but also foster community and connection to create a network of health and well-being.

We also partner with local organizations that support a healthier community.
