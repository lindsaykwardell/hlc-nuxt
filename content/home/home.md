### At HLC We Believe

<WeBelieve img="/gift-of-healing-cropped.webp" title="Healthcare is a Human Right">

Every person should be able to access the holistic care they need and deserve. Our sliding scale model works to provide quality care at an affordable price, increasing care accessibility while moving away from the healthcare delivery system that often limits the care people are able to receive.

</WeBelieve>

<WeBelieve direction="right" img="/garden.jpeg" title="Health is holistic">

Mind, body, and spirit-- health encompasses all aspects of our being and at HLC we ensure that the care we deliver affirms that.

</WeBelieve>

<WeBelieve img="/dr-kerry-craniosacral-720x478.jpg" title="Healthcare needs to be inclusive and trauma-informed">

Healthy Living Community welcomes people of all identities and lived experiences. We know and celebrate that everybody and every body is different. We acknowledge that medical trauma is real, and our goal is to support you in finding a safe home for your medical care that allows you to embrace healing when and how you are ready for it. 

</WeBelieve>

<WeBelieve direction="right" img="/IMG_0658.jpeg" title="Healthcare should be a conversation; there is no 'one size fits all' model for health">

We have a safe, affirming, clinic space and encourage open dialogue about health with your provider.

Our healthcare providers will always meet you where you are, educate, and discuss various treatment options (be it medication, supplements, acupuncture, naturopathic care, other modalities) to find an approach that best supports YOU.

</WeBelieve>

<WeBelieve img="/IMG_4793.jpg" title="Healthy communities grow healthy individuals">

Thatâ€™s why at HLC, we not only support the individual needs of our patients, but also foster community and connection to create a network of health and well-being.

We also partner with local organizations that support a healthier community.

</WeBelieve>
