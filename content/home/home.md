# Welcome to Healthy Living Community

## Your Non-Profit Community Health Center in SE Portland

<div class="py-5"><hr /></div>

### Together we can grow optimal health

At Healthy Living Community, we offer a different kind of healthcare. We serve people that:

* Want a personal and ongoing relationship with their healthcare provider in order to achieve their health and wellness goals.
* Are committed to taking action to improve their health and well-being, wherever they are on their health journey.
* Like us, believe that the healthcare and insurance industries are broken, and want to explore new models of care.

We are a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit that offers affordable patient-centered care in a beautiful and welcoming setting. We offer a sliding scale membership and office visit model, allowing our community members to pay what they can for the care they want and deserve. We focus on root causes of symptoms, and work with our patients on treatment plans that are both realistic and effective. Our patient care integrates medications with diet and exercise, as well as referrals to massage, acupuncture, naturopathic medicine and various other modalities. Our goal is to do this in a compassionate, cost-effective, and earth-friendly manner.
