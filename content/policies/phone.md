For non-urgent questions please contact us via the Patient Portal or call during our office hours when we are in clinic. You can reach us at (971) 231-HLFM (4536).

If you have an urgent health issue and require immediate assistance or advice from Dr. Kerry please call (971) 231-HLFM (4536). If she doesn’t answer right away, please leave a message and she will get back to you as soon as she can. Please use this privilege appropriately as it means interrupting work or family time.

For a life-threatening emergency, always call 911 immediately.

There may be rare times when Dr. Kerry will not be able to return your urgent call promptly (such as the cell phone battery dying unexpectedly) and what was an urgent situation becomes an emergent situation. In these cases, please don’t delay in seeking emergent care or calling 911.
