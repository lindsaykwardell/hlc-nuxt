Your appointment slot is long (typically 30-60 minutes depending on appointment type). Although we may not use the entire time slot for you appointment, this time is reserved for you and no one else. Please cancel your appointment online at least 24 hours prior to your appointment if you need to cancel. This will allow time for the slot to be filled by another patient. If you do not notify me at least 24 hours beforehand, you will be charged a $50 cancellation/no show fee.

If you do not come to your appointment without cancelling (“no show”), or cancel with less than 24 hours notice, you will be required to provide a credit card number in order to schedule another appointment. On the second “no show” or less than 24 hour cancellation, the missed appointment fee will be collected.
