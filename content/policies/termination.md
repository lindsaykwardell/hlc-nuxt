You may terminate our relationship at any time for any reason. We would appreciate communication from you expressing your desire for termination, but it is not required.

Likewise, Dr. Kerry may terminate your relationship at any time. Generally, she will reserve this measure for patients who are not abiding by the stated policies, are delinquent in paying bills, or are disrespectful to her, her clinic or her staff. If she chooses to terminate the relationship, she will notify you in writing. You will then have 30 days to find a new physician, during which time she will be available to you for urgent health issues only. You may request a transfer of medical records to your new physician.
