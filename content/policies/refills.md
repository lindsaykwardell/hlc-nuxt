Refilling prescriptions consumes a surprisingly large portion of staff time in a standard medical office. As we will be operating this clinic with minimal staff, we will not be able to refill prescriptions outside of office visits. When Dr. Kerry writes a prescription, she will give you enough refills to last at least until your next scheduled office visit. If your refills are running low, it likely means it is time to schedule your follow up appointment!

For medications that aren ºt used every day of the year, like allergy or headache medications, this policy will require you to be mindful and anticipate future refill needs during your current appointment.

If all else fails and you end up needing an emergency refill outside of an office visit, send a message or call with the drug name and dosage as well as the pharmacy phone number. We will attend to it within 24 hours. You will be charged a $15 administrative fee for this service for the first prescription, $5 for each additional prescription.

Please do NOT have your pharmacy contact us for refills. These refill requests are often auto-generated at the pharmacy or are simply incorrect, thus we will ignore them. You must contact us personally if you need an emergency refill outside of an office visit.
