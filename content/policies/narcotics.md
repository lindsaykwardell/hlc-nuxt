Dr. Kerry rarely believes it is in the best interest of her patients to rely on chronic narcotics or sedatives, and thus infrequently prescribes them. If you come to her on chronic narcotics or sedatives she will work to decrease your dose to the lowest tolerable level. Additionally, for both of your safety and hers, she requires a signed contract and random drug testing for continued prescribing.

By law, these medications cannot be refilled over the phone.
