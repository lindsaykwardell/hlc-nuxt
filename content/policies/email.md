Email can be a convenient way for us to communicate, however I encourage you to use our patient portal for most questions. Until you are set up with a portal account you can send me an email.

Please be aware that email is not entirely secure. For example, if your email address is through your employer, your employer may be able to read the messages. Likewise, there is a small possibility of interception of messages from outside parties (“hackers”). For these reasons, it is best NOT to transmit messages of a sensitive nature, such as mental health, substance abuse, or HIV status through standard email.
