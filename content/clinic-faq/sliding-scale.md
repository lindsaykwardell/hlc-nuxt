When paying for an appointment, please consider your (or you and your family’s) current financial situation (including housing, employment, debt and investments) as well as the holistic, patient-centered, care you receive at this practice.

Additionally, when determining your monthly membership payment level, please consider paying a higher fee if you frequently contact me for advice via the patient portal and/or with phone calls.

Above all, please do not stress about this process. Pay what feels right for you or your family at this time.
