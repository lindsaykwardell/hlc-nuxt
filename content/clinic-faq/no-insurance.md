A message from Dr. Kerry:

"In an ideal world, health insurance would be making health care more accessible to people. It would truly be an investment in people’s health. Unfortunately I frequently hear stories from patients how this isn’t true. Increasingly people are paying more monthly, with higher deductibles and fewer services covered. This leads people to avoid getting the care they need.

Additionally, several insurance companies have limited the providers allowed to be in the network for many of their plans. This means that patients are either paying full price to continue to see the provider they most want to see, or are seeing new providers who don’t know their history and with whom they don’t have a relationship.

It is important to me to find a way to help support my patients outside of the control of the insurance companies. My hope is to create a model of primary care that will provide good care to my patients in a way that is affordable and sustainable. My goal is that through this new model patients will actually feel that they are able to make an investment in their health."

At this time the only insurance HLC is still contracting with is OHP.
