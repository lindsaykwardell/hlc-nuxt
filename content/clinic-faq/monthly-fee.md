title: How much will the monthly membership cost?
order: "4"

It's up to you! The membership fee is sliding scale with a minimum monthly payment of $10 per member per month. Monthly payments often range from $10-50 per month. 

The monthly membership payment helps sustain the comprehensive care and resources we offer. Please consider paying a higher monthly fee if you frequently contact Dr. Kerry for care advice in the Patient Portal and/or with phone calls outside of appointment times.

But above all, pay what feels doable for you! Check out the 'Testimonials' section for current member's stories on how this model works for them.
