Healthy Living Community has established a Patient Care Fund to directly cover healthcare costs for those who may be unable to afford payments. A donation to the Patient Care Fund is tax deductible, and 100% will go towards patient care. We appreciate your generosity in helping others receive unique, holistic, patient-centered care with Dr. Kerry, keeping our mission alive and demonstrating that a different approach to delivering superior healthcare is possible. Together we can grow a healthy community!
