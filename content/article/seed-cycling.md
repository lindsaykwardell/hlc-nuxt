# Seed Cycling: A Nutritional Approach to Hormone Balance

During reproductive years (known as premenopause), many women will experience a menstrual cycle. The length of the cycle averages between 25 to 36 days. As each woman’s cycle is different, so are the monthly symptoms she may experience during her cycle. It is these symptoms that can be either mild or debilitating. 

Some symptoms women may experience include: 

•	Mild to -my uterus hates me -cramps


•	Acne that shows when you have a photoshoot (or a date)


•	Irregular bowels (cycle between can go - can’t go)


•	Bloating 


•	Mild headaches to I wish I could detach my head-migraines


•	heavy periods 


•	irregular periods – it shows up when and if it wants to


•	mood swings – Jekyll and Hyde


•	and more \[insert hormone cycle frustration here]

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms you may want to incorporate a nutritional approach that can help reduce or even alleviate some of these cycle challenges. There are many ways we can utilize food to help us with these challenges and frustrations, one such way is by incorporating the Seed Cycling method. 

#### What is Seed Cycling? And what are the benefits?

Simply, seed cycling is the consumption of specific seeds, during specific times of the menstrual cycle.  These seeds support the body's process of balancing the amount of estrogen, as well as progesterone. I will add here, they offer support for testosterone too (yes, this is an important sex hormone for females too). From this point forward, when I say “hormones” I am speaking mainly to Estrogen (estradiol) and progesterone, with a side nod to testosterone. 

*Note: seed cycling isn't a hormone replacement method; this is a method that supports the pathways and processes that are involved in the production, binding, and removal of hormones that the body has available for use.* 

Now, you may be asking, what if I am not menstruating? Will this not help me with my hormones? My answer, yes, it may help you. But I do want to point out; there is no one-size-fits-all, and therefore, you may need a more personalized approach that includes seed cycling to support your hormones and your body. 

The benefits of seed cycling include: regulating periods, reducing acne, hormone support for those with PCOS (*1*), reducing some perimenopause symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, etc.). It may also be beneficial for those with endometriosis and/or infertility issues. 

#### What are the seeds used in seed cycling?

•	Flax


•	Pumpkin


•	Sunflower 


•	Sesame

#### How do these seeds help hormones?

I love learning how nutrients, the chemicals in foods can help our health. Seeds hold an abundant amount of nutrition for our hormones and overall health. They are a great source of vitamins, minerals, protein, healthy fats, fiber, and phytochemicals that can support hormones. I could go into greater detail on the health benefits of the seeds that are used in the Seed Cycle method, but that would take up a lot of space here. So, I will leave that for another time. For now, I have highlighted some key nutrients each seed contains that are beneficial to hormone health.

***Flax Seeds:***  The main phytonutrient in flax seeds is lignan. Lignans offer many health benefits; including hormone-related benefits. Flax seeds have approximately 294.21mg/100g (~ 10 Tablespoons) of lignan (*2*). This amazing molecule engages estrogen balancing goodness. One way is its ability to bind to estrogen in the intestine. This ensures that estrogen is excreted in the feces (this supports the importance of gut health---more on that in a later post). By making sure estrogen is bound and on a path to exit the body, it keeps estrogen from being reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. This maintains estrogen balance; making sure the estrogen that is done and needs to leave does leave and doesn’t circle back around and added back into the body with the estrogen that is currently in use. For those who tend to be estrogen dominant (higher estrogen to progesterone ratio), this may be helpful for you.  

***Pumpkin seeds:*** The star here is Zinc! Pumpkin seeds have approximately 7.99mg/100g (~13 tablespoons). In reproductive health, zinc encourages the pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH is responsible for the growth of ovarian follicles and ovulation which tells the ovaries to produce progesterone in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (*3*).  I think of progesterone as the babysitter to estrogen, if the ratio of estrogen to progesterone is too high, then estrogen may eat all the ice cream and make prank phone calls. 
Zinc has also been studied in supporting healthy testosterone levels.

***Sunflower seeds:*** Sunflower seeds are a great source of vitamin E, with 35.17mg/100g (~12 tablespoons), which is an important antioxidant for the body. What role does vitamin E play in estrogen and progesterone balance? It helps with the production of progesterone during the 2nd phase of the menstrual cycle. Deficiency in Vitamin E may impact the effectiveness of cytochrome P450, which is involved in the detoxification of estrogen (*4*). This sunny seed has a lot to offer beyond vitamin E, such as copper (which is important for zinc balance- zinc to copper ratio has a connection to anxiety), and selenium. All of these are supportive of sex hormone health. 

***Sesame Seeds:*** These tiny seeds have lignans which as mentioned with flaxseeds help with balancing estrogen. They also have a few noteworthy minerals that support sex hormones and more; zinc (which we already went over), copper, and magnesium. Magnesium is one of the minerals the majority of people are deficient in. This deficiency can affect the pituitary gland, which produces the follicular stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. These hormones are in connection with estrogen and boosting progesterone. In addition, the liver needs magnesium during phase II detoxification of estrogen metabolites (*5*). If there is a deficiency of magnesium, there is a higher chance of estrogen dominance. 

All of these seeds provide nutrients that are beneficial to hormone balance, such as; Zinc, selenium, vitamin E, fiber, omega-6, and omega-3 fatty acids. All of these nutrients play important parts in relieving hormone imbalance symptoms. 

#### Menstrual cycle(*6*) phases with seed cycling: What is happening, what seeds during each phase, and how much?

**Phase 1 – Follicular - (Days 1-14):** 

 Day one= the first day of your period. 

This is the phase that creates the follicles that will, if all goes well, lead to the release of an egg. Both estrogen and progesterone are low at the beginning of this phase. Estrogen will begin to increase and peaks at day 14. Progesterone remains low until phase 2.

***Seed Cycle phase 1:  1-2 tablespoons each, fresh ground flaxseeds and pumpkin seeds***

**Phase 2- Ovulation to Luteal- (Days 15-28):**

Ovulation occurred and estrogen levels peaked and have begun to decline, while progesterone is increasing to prepare the body for a possible pregnancy. Both progesterone and estrogen will be at high levels until the egg is fertilized or not. If the egg is not fertilized, progesterone and estrogen will decrease and the menstrual cycle (bleeding) will begin. 

***Seed Cycle phase 2:  eat 1-2 tablespoons each, fresh ground sunflower and sesame seeds***

#### For those not menstruating- follow the lunar (moon) cycle

**New moon:** eat 1-2 tablespoons each, fresh ground flax seeds and pumpkin seeds. 

**Full Moon:** eat 1-2 tablespoons each of, fresh ground sunflower seeds and sesame seeds. 

*Note: If you are starting this during mid-cycle, just pick up from the day of your last period or the last lunar phase.* 

During each phase: grind seeds for the current phase and place them into a glass jar and store them in the fridge. Each day during the appropriate phase, eat 1-2 tablespoons of the seed mixture. You can add them to a smoothie, into porridge, over yogurt, sprinkle over salads, mix into soups, or make into power/energy balls.

#### For those asking, do I have to do the cycling? Can I do these seeds a different way and still get the same benefits?

If doing the seed cycling method seems daunting and you know you will forget, I did find from other resources that it may not be necessary to do the rotation. Again, everyone is different, so give the cycling method a try to determine if this method works for you. 
To provide other options, try using pre-made seed butter. If you are using pre-made seed butter, please make sure they do not have added oils, sugar, or other ingredients other than salt (if you are on a low salt diet, please make sure there is no added salt.) 
Or, you can make a seed butter. If you have a food processor you can make your own seed butter (add some of your favorite nuts to have a nut and seed butter- I have provided my recipe for Moon Butter at the end of this article). Consuming 1-2 tablespoons of this butter per day may be as effective as the cycling method. 

#### When will relief start?

This is a tricky question. Some women may find relief within a couple of cycles, some women it may take longer. I do recommend talking with a health professional that can help you with this process and your particular hormonal challenges to make adjustments to help you specifically.
