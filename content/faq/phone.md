For non-urgent questions please contact us via the Patient Portal or call during our office hours when we are in clinic. You can reach us at (971) 231-4536.

If you have an urgent health issue and require immediate assistance or advice during office hours please call (971) 231-4536.  For urgent concerns outside-of-office hours the voicemail will list the current on-call practitioner, and how you can contact them.  Please see our policies for outside-of-appointment communication below. Please use this privilege appropriately as it means interrupting family time.

For a life-threatening emergency, always call 911 immediately.

There may be rare times when a member of the HLC Team will not be able to return your urgent call promptly (such as the cell phone battery dying unexpectedly) and what was an urgent situation becomes an emergent situation. In these cases, please donâ€™t delay in seeking emergent care or calling 911.
