When Dr. Kerry writes a prescription, she will give you enough refills to last at least until your next scheduled office visit. If your refills are running low, it likely means it is time to schedule your follow up appointment! For medications that aren ºt used every day of the year, like allergy or headache medications, this policy will require you to be mindful and anticipate future refill needs during your current appointment.
