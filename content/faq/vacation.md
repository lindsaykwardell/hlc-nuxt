There will be times when our providers will be out of town or otherwise unreachable. Dates of upcoming vacation plans will be posted on the home page, mentioned in the voicemail and you will receive an auto-response message if you reach out in the portal. If you have an urgent health question or need to be seen while they are away please check the home page as it will also include a link to the website of colleagues who can help you in your providers absence.
