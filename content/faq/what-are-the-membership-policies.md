Membership is renewed at the end of each year (in November). All members will be asked to sign up again and re-commit to a membership fee for the following year.

Families can combine payments for all family members into one monthly membership cost.

You may pay your membership fee as a yearly lump sum rather than a monthly fee if you’d prefer.

Those with OHP insurance will not be asked to pay a membership fee
