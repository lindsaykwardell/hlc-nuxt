You may terminate our relationship at any time for any reason. We would appreciate communication from you expressing your desire for termination, but it is not required.

Likewise, our providers may terminate your relationship at any time. Generally, we will reserve this measure for patients who are not abiding by the stated policies or are disrespectful to us, our staff or the clinic grounds. If a provider chooses to terminate the relationship, we will notify you in writing. You will then have 30 days to find a new physician, during which time we will be available to you for urgent health issues only. You may request a transfer of medical records to your new physician.
