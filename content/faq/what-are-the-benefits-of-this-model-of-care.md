1. Cost transparency - You know exactly what you are paying for the services you receive and you wonâ€™t get bills for services the insurance companies choose not to cover
2. Holistic healthcare - The comprehensive, trauma-informed, care our providers deliver is unique, educational, affirming and meets you where you are. 
3. No changing providers - If your insurance plan changes due to work or the Marketplace, you get to have continued support and continuity with our providers
