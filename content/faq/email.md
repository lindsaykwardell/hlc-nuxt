Email can be a convenient way for us to communicate, however we ask that all health related concerns be relayed through the portal.

Email is not entirely secure. For example, if your email address is through your employer, your employer may be able to read the messages. Likewise, there is a small possibility of interception of messages from outside parties (“hackers”). For these reasons, it is best NOT to transmit messages of a sensitive nature, such as mental health, substance abuse, or HIV status through standard email.
