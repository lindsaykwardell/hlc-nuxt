We are committed to being transparent regarding the true cost of our services. Having averaged Dr. Kerry’s time, clinic staff’s time, rental of clinic space, and administration costs, we have calculated our cost for a 30 minute appointment to be $120.

See our “Services Price List” for more information on our true costs.
