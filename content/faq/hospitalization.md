We hope you will never need to be hospitalized. If hospitalization does have to occur, our providers feel that you will be best served by the hospitalist physicians (specialists in the care of hospitalized patients). Your primary care provider (PCP) will visit you at the hospital if you would like, and will communicate closely with your in hospital doctors about your health issues and the outcomes of your hospitalization.

Please tell the hospital that Dr. Kerry or Windy is your primary care physician so they can update us with all important information. Also, within a day or two of your discharge, please send a message or call so we can determine how soon you need to be seen for follow-up.
