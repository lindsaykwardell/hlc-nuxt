Our providers rarely believe it is in the best interest of our patients to rely on chronic narcotics or sedatives, and thus infrequently prescribe them. If you come already on chronic narcotics or sedatives we will work to decrease your dose to the lowest tolerable level. Additionally, for both of your safety and ours, we require a signed contract and random drug testing for continued prescribing.

By law, these medications cannot be refilled over the phone.
