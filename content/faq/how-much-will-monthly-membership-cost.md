It's up to you! The membership fee is sliding scale with a minimum monthly payment of $10 per member per month. Monthly payments often range from $10-50 per month.

The monthly membership payment helps sustain the comprehensive care and resources we offer. Please consider paying a higher monthly fee if you frequently contact Dr. Kerry for care advice in the Patient Portal and/or with phone calls outside of appointment times.

But above all, pay what feels doable for you! Check out the '[Meet our members](/membership#meet-some-of-our-community-members)' section for current member's stories on how this model works for them.
