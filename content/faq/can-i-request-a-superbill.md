Yes, you will have the option to request a superbill. You may then take the superbill and submit it to your insurance for reimbursement. Superbills are fully itemized bills that you can submit to your insurance company for possible reimbursement. See more information about superbills here:[ What is a Super Bill?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbill)

Please note, if you request a superbill for your appointment we ask that you please pay our full appointment cost (See our Price Services List). You will be reimbursed for the service at your insuranceâ€™s rate.
