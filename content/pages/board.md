Dr. Kerry has wanted to be a doctor since middle school. During medical school her long-standing expectation was confirmed, she wanted to support people through all stages of life doing family medicine.

Following residency she worked in traditional family medicine clinic during which she discovered that she needed and wanted to find a new way to practice medicine.

Dr. Kerry is the main medical provider for Healthy Living Community. HLC is a nonprofit focused on creating a healthy community in which its members can create ideal health and have access to affordable holistic and functional care. Dr. Kerry and HLC provide patients with longer appointment times and more personal treatment which she finds much more fulfilling. She has worked to create an environment where her patients feel safe and happy coming to the doctor.

Hi! My name is Mikayla and I am Healthy Living Community’s Board Secretary. Some of you may remember me as Dr. Kerry’s scribe (I was in this role for two years)! It was during my time scribing that I got to see Healthy Living Community take form and grow into the amazing health community it is today! My favorite things about HLC: the people : ) and HLC’s commitment to changing the healthcare delivery landscape to make holistic care more accessible in our communities.

A little bit about me: I am a Portland native! I am currently getting my Master’s in Public Health at OHSU. In my spare time I love to hike around the PNW, read a thick book, do a puzzle, or learn a new song on the piano.

Kat Wardell has a passion for community and turning ideas into results. Although growing up with a large family, Kat was often by herself and felt alone. After moving to Portland, OR, she felt more isolated, and yearned for some sort of community. 

This desire has driven Kat to pursue community-building so that others don’t have to feel as alone as she did. Years later, she met Dr. Kerry, who welcomed her into her community. This opened up opportunities to get involved and help create something meaningful. Kat currently works as a project manager at Rhino Digital Printing.

Having co-owned and operated a small printing company for over 20 years he brings business management and financial analysis skills to the board. He has a firm belief in the organizations mission and values as well as motivation to assist with the creation of an innovative strategy for health care delivery in a community focused model.

Carl has continually looked for ways to give back to the local community some of the success his business has enjoyed. Some of these efforts include providing print services to organizations such as, Growing Gardens whose mission is to promote home-scale organic food gardening to improve nutrition and self-reliance in underserved communities, Compassion and Choices who continues the fight for death with dignity in our life cycles, and CASA (Court appointed special advocates for children).

Due to a long series of fortunate circumstances, he met fellow board member Dr. Kerry Schaefer who introduced him to the rest of the brilliant members of the board of Healthy Living Community and decided that surrounding himself with extremely talented people was a good idea. As a board member he is excited to help further the mission and vision of our community.
