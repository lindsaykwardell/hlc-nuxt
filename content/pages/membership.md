# Membership is the BEST

When you become a Healthy Living Community member, you are joining a supportive community network of health that will holistically support you in achieving your health goals. 

## As an HLC member, you get:

We call our patients "members"

* Our calm, welcoming clinic environment.
* The ability to select the duration of your appointment to meet your healthcare needs
* 24/7 access to Dr. Kerry via phone or portal messaging.
* Reduced cost for the care resources: supplements, essential oils, etc. that we love to provide for you.
* Frequent community events/classes that build connection and grow a healthy network of support
* Discounts/offerings for health services or items from our local partner organizations 

## How membership works:

We have adopted a sliding scale monthly membership fee for HLC members. Each individual, or family, is responsible for determining their own monthly payment capabilities given their current financial situation. This model is designed to allow more people access to necessary health care services and to maintain the unique holistic functional care HLC offers.

## This is how other people apply their membership
