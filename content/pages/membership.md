- 24/7 access to Dr. Kerry via phone or portal messaging.

## How membership works:

**Membership Fee**

We have adopted a sliding scale monthly membership fee for HLC members. Each individual, or family, is responsible for determining their own monthly payment capabilities given their current financial situation. This model is designed to allow more people access to necessary health care services and to maintain the unique holistic functional care HLC offers.

The minimum monthly membership payment is **\$10 per member per month**. Payments usually range from $10-$50 per month-- you get to decide which payment feels doable for you/your family!

---**Pay by Appointment**

When you, or a family member, comes in for an appointment you will be asked to _pay what you can_ for that service at the time of visit.

We are committed to being transparent regarding our actual cost for services (see our Services Cost List). You have the option to pay for an appointment in full OR decide on a payment amount that feels doable given your financial situation. Our Services Cost listings are meant to inform, not dictate, what you can pay.

You also have the option to request a superbill to submit to your insurance for appointment cost reimbursement. (We will still bill your insurance for any labs, imaging, and prescriptions).

## Here's what some of our members are saying:

<div class="w-full lg:w-1/2 p-6 lg:rounded-tl-lg bg-hlc-green-100 shadow">

"I found Dr. Kerry after my first was born and my midwife helped me realize my baby needed a tongue tie revision. I grew up relatively healthy but started having some increasing chronic issues towards the end of high school and medical care regarding those led to dismissal and traumatization. I was thrilled to find such a caring and thoughtful provider in Dr. Kerry to follow my son's healthcare, and my daughter's when she was born a couple of years later. 

We sadly had to leave the clinic just before my daughter's first birthday due to insurance change, and our new pediatrician spurred a very traumatic year+ for her regarding growth and feeding. As quickly as possible, we changed insurance again and were able to see Dr. Kerry for both kids, and also myself to help with hEDS management. 

I am so appreciative of the community Dr. Kerry is building and that my family is able to continue to be part of a place that treats and values whole people. We travel a bit for regular appointments and find it incredibly worthwhile."

Dr. Kerry Schaefer saved my life!
I met Dr. Kerry right around the third month after my son just passed. 

Kindness<br />
Empathy<br />
Real<br />
Reliable<br />
Youthful<br />

Spells Kerry. 

Dr. Kerry is a woman doctor who listens, cares, finds answers, and never leaves you just wondering what is wrong or not wrong.

She is an incredible doctor. She listens to you, never assumes she knows, and finds the answers. 

She saved my life. Physically. Mentally. Emotionally.

She is a great gift to all who have the opportunity to have her as their doctor.

<div class="w-full lg:w-1/2 p-6 lg:rounded-bl-lg bg-hlc-magenta-100 shadow">

 Dr. Kerry Schaefer has been my rock and greatest support in all aspects of my life for the last three years. I am so fortunate to be under her care and I could not be more grateful üíú

 On top of helping me manage my supplements and medication changes, Dr. Kerry has provided me referrals to other healthcare providers who specialize in my conditions, helped get me connected to a non-profit attorney to help me receive disability, guided me through my toughest mental health days, and given me numerous bodywork adjustments that help keep my health on track and my mindset more optimistic. 

One of the things I really appreciate about Dr. Kerry is her desire to see me succeed and find peace. She helps me achieve this through small daily things, one of which is the use of conscious language, in person, and in our correspondence. I have fun with her trying to find the best way to communicate what I‚Äôm going through, without bogging myself down with negative self-talk (as often as possible, we all know sometimes it‚Äôs helpful to vent without trying to put a positive twist on it, and Dr. Kerry supports me through those moments as well). 

I know I am loved and cared for by Dr. Kerry, and it feels like she has brought my family in as an extension of her own. You don‚Äôt find people like her in life very often, and when you do, it's like striking gold. She is truly a precious gem of a human and one I intend to treasure for as long as I possibly can. 

If you are like me and have struggled to find proper support and medical care from common medical professionals your whole life, I think you will be very happy to find Dr. Kerry is exactly the fit you needed all along.

 Healthy Living Community changed my life and I‚Äôm inspired to invite my friends and family to join this amazing community. 

I‚Äôve always struggled with my health. I was often sick, depressed and anxious, and friendless. Doctors talked to me for five minutes, gave me a pill that would treat symptoms, but caused more problems. I felt life was not worth living, and I wanted to die. 
 
I got worse, and I knew that the path I was on would lead to more pills, doctors, and pain. I needed to try something different.
 
I turned to the Internet. I read countless articles and blogs. Everyone thought I was crazy. I was routinely asked, ‚ÄúWhy would you change your diet?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would you not take the prescriptions?‚Äù I regularly heard, ‚ÄúI would die if I couldn‚Äôt eat gluten!‚Äù I was left to figure it all out by myself. But I did it; I got better, my body inflammation reduced, and I felt happiness and joy. I didn‚Äôt want to die anymore.
 
I started to make friends. I got married, and had a child. During that time, I met Dr. Kerry, and I asked her to be my child‚Äôs doctor. I just needed someone who would do checkups, and otherwise stay away from my family. I‚Äôd dealt with enough doctors to know that I hated all of them. But something magical happened: Dr. Kerry became a friend. And when I hit a bump on my health journey, I turned to her for myself. Through her, and the amazing community that surrounds her, I have become stronger, happier, and more self-aware. Now I have support on bad days, ideas from the community for meals, and new ways to handle ailments.
 
I donate to the Healthy Living Community Patient Fund every month because the last 3 ¬Ω years that I have had a community and people to support me have been amazing. My health and happiness have increased faster than when I did it all by myself. I would not be who I am now without the support of this community, and I freakin‚Äô love myself.

And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking you to join me in spreading the word!
