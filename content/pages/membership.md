# Membership is the BEST

When you become a Healthy Living Community member, you are joining a supportive community network of health that will holistically support you in achieving your health goals. 

We fundamentally value each and every one of our members and the individual talents/gifts/ideas/worldview they bring to our community. 

## Joining our community has numerous benefits! As an HLC member, you get:

* Our calm, welcoming clinic environment.
* The ability to select the duration of your appointment to meet your healthcare needs
* 24/7 access to Dr. Kerry via phone or portal messaging.
* Reduced cost for the care resources: supplements, essential oils, etc. that we love to provide for you.
* Frequent community events/classes that build connection and grow a healthy network of support
* Discounts/offerings for health services or items from our local partner organizations 

## How membership works:

**Membership Fee**

We have adopted a sliding scale monthly membership fee for HLC members. Each individual, or family, is responsible for determining their own monthly payment capabilities given their current financial situation. This model is designed to allow more people access to necessary health care services and to maintain the unique holistic functional care HLC offers.

The minimum monthly membership payment is **$10 per member per month**. Payments usually range from $10-$50 per month-- you get to decide which payment feels doable for you/your family!

**Pay by Appointment**

When you, or a family member, comes in for an appointment you will be asked to _pay what you can_ for that service at the time of visit.

We are committed to being transparent regarding our actual cost for services (see our Services Cost List--INSERT LINK). You have the option to pay for an appointment in full OR decide on a payment amount that feels doable given your financial situation. Our Services Cost listings are meant to inform, not dictate, what you can pay.

You also have the option to request a superbill to submit to your insurance for appointment cost reimbursement. (We will still bill your insurance for any labs, imaging, and prescriptions).
