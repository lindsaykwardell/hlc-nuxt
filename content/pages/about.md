# Healthy Living Community

## Creating health through community building, education, and affordable holistic care 

## Together we can grow optimal health

In an ideal world, health insurance would improve the accessibility of health care. It would truly be an investment in people’s health. But increasingly, people are paying more per month, with higher deductibles and fewer benefits. This discourages people from getting the care they need.

In this world of increasing health insurance costs, limited insurance coverage, and fluctuating economic stability, how do we as a community come together to support health and wellness? How do we create a system that ensures access to a trusted provider who will take the time to support the well-being of our families no matter their financial means?

**Healthy Living Community is the answer to these questions.**

HLC has integrated a model of care that offers a low cost sliding-scale membership fee and “pay what you can” per appointment. We no longer contract with insurance, with the exception of OHP*. We understand that many will still utilize insurance for their specific health needs. At HLC, individuals with insurance will receive their standard insurance coverage for all labs, imaging, prescriptions and referrals to other providers. Additionally, insurance companies often try to dictate what providers you see and what care you receive. At HLC, we believe you should have autonomy in deciding what provider and care best meet your health needs.

We are committed to cost transparency, and appreciate that this model of care provides flexibility to our members--allowing them to make payments based on their current financial situation. Those who are able to pay a higher monthly membership, or the full cost for an appointment, will help offset the cost for individuals who may be unable to afford healthcare at this time. Our goal is to make Healthy Living Community’s unique functional healthcare accessible to all.

**At Healthy Living Community, we believe that healthy communities grow healthy individuals.** We foster growth in our community by holding regular events (classes, workshops, gatherings), establishing platforms for communication among our members, and ensuring our clinic is an affirming and supportive place for all. We also are also establishing connections with local organizations to build a supportive network of health.

With this healthcare model, people are able to make meaningful investments in their, and their community’s, health. Together, we can work to create a sustainable community of wellness for all of us here at Health Living Community. Let’s demonstrate to other health communities that a different accessible approach that provides superior care is possible.

\*We listened to the feedback of our community members and realized that not accepting OHP (Oregon’s Medicaid program) was a barrier to many community members who are unable to afford healthcare costs. In taking OHP we hope to ensure that functional, holistic, healthcare services are more accessible.

## Meet Dr. Kerry Schaefer

</div>

Kerry grew up in beautiful Hood River. She headed across the country to attend college at Amherst College in Massachusetts where she majored in Theater and Dance. After working for Americorps in Philadelphia for a year and spending another year enjoying dance and travel she started medical school in Madison, Wisconsin.

During medical school her long-standing expectation was confirmed, she wanted to be a family medicine doctor. She was very excited to make it back to the Pacific Northwest to start her family medicine residency at Providence Milwaukie Hospital.

Following residency she worked in traditional family medicine clinic during which she discovered that she needed and wanted to find a new way to practice medicine. She did not like trying to see as many patients per day as possible. She started Healthy Living Family Medicine to provide her patients with longer appointment times and more personal treatment which she finds much more fulfilling. She wants to create an environment where her patients feel safe and happy coming to the doctor.

In July 2019, Kerry transitioned the clinic to Healthy Living Community, a nonprofit focused on creating a healthy community in which its members can create ideal health and have access to affordable holistic and functional care. 

She lives in southeast Portland in with her partner Carl, their daughters Sydney and Rachel. She loves the outdoors. She currently spends most of her free time with her family or training in aerial dance.

Meet Karen Davis, MS, CNS®, a clinical nutritionist who began her career in evidenced-based nutrition when she recognized the key role food choice plays in preventing many of the chronic diseases we face today.

After completing her Master of Science in Nutrition, Karen went on to earn a national credential with the Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists®. Karen participated in a therapeutic ketogenic diet training course through the American Nutrition Association and passed the exam to become a Certified Ketogenic Nutrition Specialist℠ which now enables her to specialize in this medically-supervised approach to disease management to provide safe and effective outcomes. The way in which Karen does this is through working with her client seeing them as a whole person, in a judgement-free environment, and starts wherever they may be in their journey. She helps establish attainable goals and specific recommendations, knowing that permanent change takes time; all the while providing coaching, education and a whole lot of encouragement. As a member of the Healthy Living Community team, Karen provides EAV (Vega) Food Sensitivity Testing as well as one-on-one nutritional counseling.

Karen is the owner of Karen Davis Nutrition where she is able to bring her own unique approach to help and support her clients to make successful, long lasting changes to their food and lifestyle choices.

When not nerding out on all things nutrition, you will find Karen working out, reading, and exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest with her rescue dog, Lucy.
