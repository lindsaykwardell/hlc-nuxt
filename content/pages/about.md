# Healthy Living Community

### Together we can grow optimal health

In an ideal world, health insurance would increase the accessibility of health care. It would truly be an investment in people’s health. Unfortunately, I often hear from patients that this isn’t true. Increasingly, people are paying more per month, with higher deductibles and fewer benefits. This discourages people from getting the care they need.

Additionally several insurance companies have limited the providers allowed to be in the network for many of their plans. This means that patients either pay full price to stay with their preferred provider, or are forced to see new providers who don’t know their history and with whom they don’t have a relationship.

In this world of increasing health insurance costs, limited insurance coverage, and fluctuating economic stability, how do we as a community come together to support health and wellness? How do we create a system that ensures access to a trusted provider who will take the time to support the well-being of our families--while also ensuring the same access to quality care for families who do not have the financial means?

The transition of Healthy Living Family Medicine to a new care model is my answer to these questions.

On July 1st 2019, Healthy Living Family Medicine integrated a new model of care that offers a low cost sliding-scale monthly membership fee and a “pay what you can” per appointment. We no longer be contract with or bill insurance. It is important to me to find a way to support my patients outside of the control of the insurance companies. Please note, individuals with insurance will still receive their standard insurance coverage for all lab testing, imaging, prescriptions and referrals to other providers.

I believe my patients will find this new model empowering and supportive for themselves and their family's health. Patients will be in control and able to choose what they spend on their health care and have complete transparency for costs as well as the clinic's needs. Patients will not have to wonder or wait to find out what insurance may or may not cover. Patients will continue to have access to the consistent and comprehensive care that Dr. Kerry provides, and also have access to a broad range of new community services such as group classes in the studio and our new infrared sauna. I believe that this community-based model will be nourishing for my patients' holistic health and aligned with their diverse financial needs.

Many individuals and families already face a variety of financial challenges, and now are being called on to pay more. It is not my intention to financially burden you. I trust my patients to do the work necessary to clarify how much they can pay, with the hope that they keep in mind that there are individuals and families who have less. Those who choose to pay at the higher end of the monthly membership cost, or full cost for an appointment, will help offset the costs for those who may be unable to afford healthcare at this time. I aim to create a model of primary care that will allow me to serve my patients in a way that is affordable and sustainable. My goal is that this new model will allow patients to feel that they are able to make a true and more meaningful investment in their, and their community’s, health.

Together, we can work to create a sustainable community of wellness for all of us here at Healthy Living Family Medicine. Let’s demonstrate to other health communities that a different approach that provides superior care is possible.

# Meet Dr. Kerry Schaefer

#### A little something about the doctor

<flex>

<div class="md:w-3/5 flex-auto">

Kerry grew up in beautiful Hood River. She headed across the country to attend college at Amherst College in Massachusetts where she majored in Theater and Dance. After working for Americorps in Philadelphia for a year and spending another year enjoying dance and travel she started medical school in Madison, Wisconsin.

During medical school her long-standing expectation was confirmed, she wanted to be a family medicine doctor. She was very excited to make it back to the Pacific Northwest to start her family medicine residency at Providence Milwaukie Hospital.

Following residency she worked in traditional family medicine clinic during which she discovered that she needed and wanted to find a new way to practice medicine. She did not like trying to see as many patients per day as possible. She started Healthy Living Family Medicine to provide her patients with longer appointment times and more personal treatment which she finds much more fulfilling. She wants to create an environment where her patients feel safe and happy coming to the doctor.

She lives in southeast Portland with her partner Carl and their daughters Sydney and Rachel. She loves the outdoors. She currently spends most of her free time with her family or training in aerial dance.
