Healthy Living Community has a wonderful garden space behind the clinic that is open for community members to explore, sit, and find connection with nature. Come walk our labyrinth (built by our community members!), sit beneath the trees, and and enjoy this healing space. 

We also have spaces for members to plant and grow vegetables. Please contact [Liz](mailto:liz@hlcomm.org) to learn more.
