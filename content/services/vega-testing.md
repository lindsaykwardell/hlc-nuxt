Vega testing is an electrodermal food-sensitivity and environmental allergen testing approach that measures the body's response to various potential inflammatory agents (food or allergens) through an acupuncture meridian. This is a safe, non-invasive, option for testing-- and we are excited that this resource is now readily accessible to our members (there is only one other clinic in the greater Portland area that performs this testing aside from HLC!). Karen Davis MS, CNS, is currently running Vega testing at HLC. Call the clinic number to schedule today!
