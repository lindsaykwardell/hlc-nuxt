Dr. Kerry is board-certified in Functional Medicine. Functional Medicine is a care approach that works to find the root-cause of symptoms you are experiencing, not treating to put a band-aid over symptoms. Dr. Kerry often explores genetics, toxin exposures, diet, and underlying infections--working with patients to find an individualized, holistic, treatment plan.
