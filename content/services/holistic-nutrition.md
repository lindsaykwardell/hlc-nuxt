Holistic nutrition is a nutritional approach that takes into consideration an individualâ€™s health as a whole complex system of; physical, chemical, mental, emotional, social, spiritual, and environmental connections. Within this nutrition practice, clients get help in identifying how the foods they eat, their relationship with food, and their lifestyle choices are all connected to their health challenges. In addition, each client is supported in their personal process of recovering and healing, through compassionate guidance in utilizing healing foods and lifestyle modification. Our Nutritionist utilizes knowledge, tools, and experience in nutritional assessments and creating personalized nutrition plans that provide nutritional and lifestyle recommendations and modifications that will embrace the whole person.
