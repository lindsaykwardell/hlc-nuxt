Dr. Kerry is trained in infant massage, and provides home visits at 2-5 days and 2 weeks of life. As a mom herself, she knows it can be difficult to leave the house early in your childʼs life. Additionally, home visits decrease your newbornʼs exposure to illness while they are still building their immune system.
