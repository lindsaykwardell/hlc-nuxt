title: "Craniosacral Therapy"
---

Dr. Kerry provides craniosacral therapy to children and adults. This gentle bodywork technique may be incorporated into regular problem-based visits or scheduled as an individual visit all its own. Dr. Kerryâ€™s goal with these treatments is to improve mobility and function throughout the body as all body parts should be able to move independently of each other.
