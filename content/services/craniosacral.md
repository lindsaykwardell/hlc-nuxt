title: "Craniosacral Therapy"
---

Dr. Kerry and Dr. Susanne provide craniosacral therapy to children and adults. This gentle bodywork technique may be incorporated into regular problem-based visits or scheduled as an individual visit all its own. Our goal with these treatments is to improve mobility and function throughout the body as all body parts should be able to move independently of each other.
