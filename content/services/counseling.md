Our clinical social workers, Samantha and Katie, believe that our experiences, relationships, and stories impact us in fundamental and profound ways, and that counseling can be an important component of health and wellness. Katie and Samantha share a commitment to an affirming, supportive, and non-judgmental practice that encourages each client to feel safe in exploring issues that matter most to them. Fees are sliding scale.
